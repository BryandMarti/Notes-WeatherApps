  <h3>The Benefits of learning how to create an app, as well as the server along with it.</h3>
  <p>Before I started this program I had no idea on how to create a dedicated link for my apps, now I feel a bit more comfortable with the steps to follow to have a working website/app on my own. and I also learned how to debug my own code, and used new tools such as Heroku, and much more NPM modules.</p>


  <h3>List of Commands</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>node app.js add --title="" --body=""</li>
    <li>node app.js remove --title="" --body=""</li>
    <li>node app.js list</li>
    <li>node app.js read --title=""</li>
  </ul>
